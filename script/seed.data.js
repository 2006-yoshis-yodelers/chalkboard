Of course, there's more to it than that. The course also examines pressing modern matters such as “girl culture, 21st century suburban revivalism, the indie music scene, the meta-series, and more.” These, of course, are the features by which The O.C. “changed teen television dramedy forever.” Just in case watching episodes of The O.C. in class doesn't seem like the greatest cerebral challenge you'll face in college, this class ups the ante by also including analytical discussion of cultural touchstones like Real Housewives of Orange County and The Hills.

      "Point is, if you're going to design roller coasters and log flumes, it's a great idea to know exactly what you're doing. And that's not just because this is serious life and death stuff. It's also because nobody likes a boring ride. There's a fine line between feeling like you might die and actually running the risk. Theme Park Engineering majors are those special individuals who know the exact mathematical equation for riding that line. At California State University in Long Beach, you can become one of these individuals by successfully earning your Bachelor of Science in Engineering with an Option in Theme Park Engineering. First entering the course catalog in 1999, Theme Park Engineering requires foci in electrical, civil, and mechanical engineering as well as hydraulic and pneumatic control. These are pretty much all the things you'll need to know if you ever wish to design a Gravitron, repair a Tilt-a-Whirl, or reduce the vomit-factor of a Teacups ride gone haywire.",

    Transform economic data from .csv into a more meaningful representation to help filter out
    noise and aid in knowledge extraction.
    \n
    The key will be addressing the psychic element which we studied in Innovation &
    Entrepreneurship at Carleton. We want to portray cause and effect interactions, or at least the
    correlation across economic measures including GDP per capita in order to demonstrate how
    equilibriums are properly obtained.\n
    • Include the Pearson correlation coefficient, and elements of text sentiment analysis for
    parsing economic data when we load it into Mathematica.\n
    • Provide pre-flight middleware for handling data by mutating its form with proper indexing.\n
    • Hopefully we’re able to provide Game Theory solutions to make a fun, exciting package
    which provides insights out of the box for all.`

    Qooley who combines expert sleight of hand magic with comedy, juggling and other
    vaudevillian variety skills to create a unique and amazing show, the House of Cards, Nashville.
    Here, we hope to create a Nash equilibrium showing how we got here, the link between
    creation and destruction based on our abstract, Schumpeterian model of human behavior.
    \n
    We can do this statistically; in machine learning there is a lot of statistics involved for which we
    interact with the architecture of what we are building. In deep learning, instead of interacting
    with the architecture of what we are building, we might have an auto-encoder do this
    statistically, like having many neurons at once which are greater than the sum of their parts as
    opposed to having a single neuron. As a data science person, we can focus on simulating the
    economy through the middle land between data science and software engineering.`

    In object-oriented programming, we are always looking for primes. Ordinarily, finding prime
    numbers is like making a resource load request; we get throttled because of a lack of
    formatting, a lack of an ability to transmit objects into their final form. Units and being able to
    specify units in-line helps us resolves values which cannot be determined from the information
    given.\n
    One aspect of this project would be counting the number of ways to define the space which is
    not prime numbers; we often use 1 - P(event) as a metric.\n
    • Organizing prime numbers by producing a map for which the degenerate elements are
    primes, we can find communities between them in their dimension.\n
    • Oftentimes we can simplify the process of division by looking at the last few integers with
    disregard to the nearest least common multiple. For instance, dividing by 8 means looking at
    everything after the thousandth digit.\n
    • Making really complicated problems like this explain themselves to you in the code, making
    understandable code which performs heavy lifting is the dream.`

    The evaluation of conditional expressions across continuous domains is the key aspect
    to equation solving. Currently, when we quantify systems of equations and inequalities,
    variable weight is by propensity to interact. Provided with imperfect raw data and our
    goal of determining variable interaction, we want to know different approaches and
    weighted values for these approaches.
    \n
    A meta-weighting of the system of weights, as well as what the variables represent,
    should be paramount.\n
    • We can implement this by adding a function, call it VisualizeInteraction, which can plot
    variables and demonstrate how they interact in 3d space.\n

    • Alternatively, add variable correlation as a graphical feature to the Plot function. Make
    this an add-on for Wolfram as it exists in C, allow the level of interaction to be
    visualized and summed across time series.\n
    • X- and y- intercepts are numbers instead of points. Finding regression lines of
    symmetry and reflecting the variables across the regression line, plotting the negative
    side of a positively focused parabola across the x-axis can help us predict the way in
    which the invisible negative side of the graph leads to imaginary solutions which
    interact with what we do see.`

    This has everything to do with the order in which data is loaded. When building Qooley.com, we
    encountered elements on this.state appearing asynchronously because of recursive functions
    which call themselves until the condition of all data on board is met. NestList function in
    Wolfram Mathematica does this with trigonometric functions on expressions, n times. A project
    in which variable interactions can be visualized to keep runtime flowing while continuing to
    provide current quantitative or numerical variables (such as the age of individuals) versus
    categorical or non-numerical variables (such as the eye color of individuals), visualizing the
    interaction in one statistics multi-threaded package.
    \n
    Include all measures of central tendency, position, dispersion, frequency, weight variables
    based on the frequency of interaction, map variables to their intersection and union, and
    address the inclusion-exclusion principle within a one-stop shop for statistical variable
    interaction in one Wolfram language package.`

    Identify conditions necessary for graphs to develop a certain way. Applications: This is the

    analogous to the geometric shape of a geodesic dome.\n
    Create an object-oriented graph traversal package which diminishes the user interface so that
    graphs can be traversed as autonomously as possible. See applications to how objects such
    as nanoparticles can be self-assembling and simulated within the existing parameters provided
    by the Wolfram user.\n
    • At Carleton when we graph ListPolarPlot in Chaotic Dynamics class, we specify incremental
    parameters in proper format which takes advantage of the existing style, range, and axes.
    • Create a function similar to MinimalPolynomial, JordanDecomposition, or
    CharacteristicPolynomial for matrices, like OptimumTraversal.\n

    Keeping track of variable names requires us to declare and identify the stage. Changing values

    positive and negative solutions to physical situations like the rate of heat transfer from a coffee
    mug, portraying different solutions to difference of squares when, for instance, factoring prime
    numbers.
